## 🚀 Key Features
- **Dynamic Selection:** Interactive seat layout where users can select/deselect seats.
- **Real-time Pricing:** Automatically calculates total price and seat count based on the selected movie.
- **Data Persistence:** Uses `localStorage` to ensure selected seats and movie choices remain even after refreshing the page.
- **State Management:** Logic to distinguish between **Available**, **Selected**, and **Occupied** seats.
- **Responsive Design:** Clean and modern UI that adapts to different screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
This project allowed me to strengthen my fundamentals in:
* **DOM Manipulation:** Efficiently updating the UI dynamically based on user input.
* **Event Delegation:** Using a single event listener on a parent container to manage multiple seat clicks, optimizing performance and memory usage.
* **JSON Handling:** Converting complex UI states (arrays of seat indexes) into strings for local storage and parsing them back on page load.
* **Array Methods:** Utilizing methods like `map()`, `spread operators`, and `indexOf()` to track and store seat selections accurately.
